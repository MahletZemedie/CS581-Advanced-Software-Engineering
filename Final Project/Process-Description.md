In this project, we are going to build a plugin on Jenkins that can add users in a batch from a CSV file, text file or other formats. Secondly, we are looking at enhancing the plugin to assist in batch role allocation and role management. We plan to use the Agile development process and Scrum methodologies to monitor the project progress and to increase the productivity of the team in a way that Quality, Time/resources, and functionality are never compromised. 
<p>We organize the team by having a meeting every other day. We communicate, share documents, and update progress through Slack. At this stage, the team's higher priority is learning about Jenkins API and how to build a plugin to import data into Jenkins. Therefore all of the team members are working on the same task which is finding documentation, and learn about Jenkins and using the admin's user access credentials to automate Jenkin processes.
